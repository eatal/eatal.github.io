I am a Research Scientist at the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I work with [Prof. Sertac Karaman](http://karaman.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in the [Autonomy and Embedded Robotics Accelerated (AERA) group](http://aera.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at LIDS. I obtained my PhD degree from the [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu){:target="_blank"} at MIT, and BSc and MSc degrees from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl){:target="_blank"}.

I am an applied researcher, with a love for fundamental science.
My research on innovative mobile autonomy is at the intersection of aerospace/mechanical engineering and robotics, and
combines aspects of control theory and motion planning with machine learning, optimization, applied aerodynamics, and vehicle and electronics design.
I am particularly interested in leveraging methods from robust control theory and differential games to safely bring fast and highly-maneuverable robots out of research labs and into the real world.
